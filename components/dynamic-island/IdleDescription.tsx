        <p>As much as I can, I focus on creating things I love.</p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s why, as my first project upon completing my first
          animation course, I chose something that{" "}
          <span className="font-medium">genuinely interests</span> me. I want to
          achieve two goals at the same time: to gain the maximum amount of
          learning and to experience great satisfaction with the outcome.

          My initial interest in re-creating this came from Emil&apos;s post
          titled &apos;

          I love the Dynamic Island because it&apos;s one of those things that
          seems easy to come up with in retrospect, but in reality, is very hard
          to bring into existence, much like what{" "}

          Being able to conjure new things through my own lens of seeing the
          world is the ultimate goal. But for now, as an amateur web animation
          designer and engineer, I will imitate the works of those greater than
          me—not just the gestalt, but also the{" "}
          <span className="italic">feel</span> of their design—while trying to
          comprehend how they make their decisions.
