I tried re-creating the Create a Story animation in iPhone's Gallery while describing how I understand and designed it.

It is not an exact copy of the original animation due to limitation in knowledge about motion and design, and the limitation in the technology used to replicate this.

#### We all have these memories that we want to remember

> We all have memories we want to treasure forever

We all have memories we wish to hold forever

#### Even though we gathered this from different places and at different times, when we look at it as a whole, it's as if they compressed to a single meaning

Though gathered from different places and different times, as a whole, it converges into one meaning

#### A lot of times, we try to cherish one special memory; remembering the exact details, the exact feelings

So often, we try to hold onto one precious memory, capturing every detail, the/its exact feeling

#### But our memory is fleeting! Looking at it long enough, it tries to remove itself from our mind's grasp, illuminating intently

Yet (a) memory is fleeting! Staring at it too long, it tries to escape our mind, glowing out with intensity

Yet our memory is fleeting! Stare too long, and it slips from our mind, illuminating intensely as it vanishes

> Yet our memory is fleeting! Stare too long and it slips from our mind, illuminating intensely as it dissipate

Yet our memory is fleeting! Stare too long, and it slips from our mind, illuminating intensely as it fades away

#### But nothing is lost. Without forgetting, we will not be able to remember other memories which are also precious for us

> But nothing is truly lost; for without forgetting, we cannot recall other memories that are equally precious

But nothing is truly lost. For without forgetting, we cannot recall other memories that are equally dear

#### Because in reality, all our memories changes from one to another, some goes back again and again, others submerged to the deeper part of our mind

And in reality, our memories transform constantly, some circling back, while others sink into the depths of our mind

#### There are memories we do not understand, never getting the reason why it happened

There are memories that remain beyond our understanding, leaving us without an explanation

> There are memories we cannot quite grasp, never knowing the reason they unfolded

#### Unless we look at a power from beyond

> Until we look at a power that lies beyond

Unless we look at a power that lies beyond

Unless we seek a power that lies beyond

#### Striking our memories, altering and forming its meaning

> Striking our memories, transforming and weaving their meaning

Striking our memories, altering and weaving their meaning

#### Once we recognized such power exists, we soon notice that they are all around us, all the time

Once we recognized such power exists, we begin to sense it, everywhere, all the time

Once we acknowledged such power exists, we begin to sense it everywhere, all the time

Once we acknowledged such power exists, we start to sense it everywhere, all the time

Once we acknowledged such power exists, we start to perceive it everywhere, all the time

> Once we acknowledged such power exists, we start to perceive it everywhere, at all times

#### Introducing new memories, we would never have if we just rely on the meaning we derived from within our power

Giving us new memories, we would never have if we just rely on the meaning we derived from within our power

Imparting new memories, we would never have if we just rely on the meaning we derived from within ourselves

Unlocking new memories, we would never have if we just rely on the meaning we derived from within ourselves.

> Unfolding new memories, we would never have if we just rely on the meaning we derived from within ourselves.

Granting new memories, we would never have if we just rely on the meaning we derived from within ourselves.

#### These new kind of memories are powerful enough to evoke other memories

These new kinds of memories carry a power to awaken and evoke other memories

These new kinds of memories evoke others, awakening them to the surface

These new forms of memories evoke others, awakening them to the surface

> Powerful enough, these new kinds of memories have the power to evoke and awaken others

#### So powerful that when it changes, it energizes other connected memories!

Powerful indeed, that when it changes, it energize other connected memories!

> Powerful indeed, that its transformation energizes all other memories!

#### And we need to notice that this does not happen to just one memory, but to every memories at certain time. Imagine how fleeting our memories are, how meaningful they are!

This happens to every memories at a certain time, both changing and maintaining the totality of our minds

Every memory meets this moment, evolving while holding the uniqueness of our soul

This happens to each memory in time, renewing while retaining the completeness of our soul

Every memory undergoes this transformation, renewing yet upholding the wholeness of our soul

This metamorphosis comes to all memories in time, altering yet sustaining the wholeness of our soul

> Then, we will soon realize that this transformation happens to all of our memories; changing our perception of the past which then changes how we see ourselves

#### Altogether, these changes in memories hapenning from within, and changes in memories caused by power from beyond, make up our life.

(Altogether,) the shifts in memories, both from within and from a power beyond, combine to form our life

> (Together,) these transformations in memories — both from within and from a power beyond ourselves — define the meaning of our existence

2 "as a whole" sounds bad
2 updated as "collectively" but still awkward
2 now it's "somehow" or "curiously", "converges" is now awkward

14? is very awkward, "pilit", 15 too
